**Persistence**

The larger your application, the more tables you will have, and the more ways they will intersect. Database schema design is especially important for fullstack applications. Take a look at Facebook's system of comments. A user can have many posts, and a post can have many comments. A comment belongs to a user. But a comment can also have replies, which also belong to a user. What would that schema look like?

**users** |
---|
id |
name |
profile_photo_url |
bio |

**posts** |
---|
id |
content |
user_id |

**comments** |
---|
id |
content |
user_id |
post_id |

**replies** |
---|
id |
content |
user_id |
comment_id |

What about likes, though? A user can leave a like for any or all of these objects. Would there be separate like tables for posts, comments, and replies? There may not always be an easy solution to these problems, but Facebook uses a MySQL database, so it can be done!
